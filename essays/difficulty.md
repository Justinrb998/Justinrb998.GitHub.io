# Stack Overflow
  A website that has helped many programmers, whether they were at advanced, intermediate or beginning levels. It has a treasure trove of knowledge within its domain, but its real value is in what it might do for you. Through using this website you can solve the many numerous mysteries you may find in your programming journey. However, it is imperative that you use the correct methods involved, or you may end up with more than you bargained for... 

  In reality, it is a powerful website that allows programmers to ask and answer each other's problems, like a digital congregation of masters in their fields sharing their knowledge. Asking the wrong questions may get you kicked out of this circle, so take heed these words.

## Good Questions

A good question on Stack Overflow may be one that asks for help in fixing an issue, while giving as much information on their end as possible. This both allows greater help without the need for a back and forth, and to prove that the asker knows enough to understand and implement the answers given. An example: 
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/134845/which-href-value-should-i-use-for-javascript-links-or-javascriptvoid0

## Bad Questions

Bad questions are questions that provide little to no information on required details, ask for way too much help, or are questions that could very easily be found via a quick google search or through the documentation. An example: 
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1642028/what-is-the-operator-in-c-c

Overall, it is important to provide as much information as necessary (without exceeding this) and to make sure that there are not already resources available to you elsewhere.
