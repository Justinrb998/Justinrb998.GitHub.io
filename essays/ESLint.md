I've only been using ESLint for a week now, and even in this short time, I feel as though it is a promising tool for my coding journey. One of its standout features is its ability to catch mistakes early on. In just a few coding exercises, I’ve had ESLint find many syntax errors and potential bugs. This early feedback has given me a boost in confidence, especially as I'm still getting comfortable with writing in TypeScript.

Another benefit is the way ESLint enforces a consistent coding style. Having a set of rules keeps my code clean and uniform, and this consistency not only makes it easier for me to read my code but also prepares me better for working in team environments, where coding standards are crucial. I appreciate that these rules are customizable, which means I can gradually create my coding style while still keeping to good practices.

However, there are a couple of drawbacks that I’ve experienced so far. The initial setup was very overwhelming. There were so many configuration options that I wasn't quite sure what all the rules did, and I felt a bit lost at times. Sometimes, the default rules felt a bit too strict, flagging minor style choices that I didn't think warranted changes. This occasionally interrupted my workflow, making me have to pause and rewrite my code even in the beginning lines of a project. Also for me personally, I struggled greatly to get my computer to install node as it seemed particulary error-happy.

Overall, even though my experience with ESLint is still very new, the tool has already shown potential in helping me write cleaner, more error-free code. I would like to keep exploring its features and to slowly adjust its settings until it feels like a natural extension of my developing process.
