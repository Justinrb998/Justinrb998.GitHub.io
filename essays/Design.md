## The Benefits of Design Patterns

Design patterns are really helpful to better understand how to write clean and organized code, especially while working on a team project for a class. Our group is building a website that connects to a database, and things were (and still are) kind of messy. Everyone has different ways of writing functions and handling data. Due to Eslint, we started using relatively similar design patterns, and found it easier to stay on the same page.

One thing that helped us a lot was using a simpler structure for our webpages. We tried to keep our pages, components and CSS organized by separating what each part of the site does. Using ESLint checks our code and gives warnings if something doesn’t look right. That helped us write code the same way, so it was easier to understand each other’s work. It also saved us from making mistakes that would bite us in deployment.

Another helpful idea was breaking our webpages into small pieces that we could reuse. Using React, we split up our code so each component did just one job, and will be reusable on multiple pages. That also makes things easier to fix and change. In the end, our code looked much cleaner and worked better as a team project.

Overall, design patterns gave our team a better structure and helped us avoid some common beginner mistakes. They made our code easier to read and work with, especially since we were using GitHub to collaborate. It’s a lot easier to merge code when it follows the same design approach. I feel like I’ve learned not just how to write code, but how to build software in a way that makes sense for a team.
