As of the moment of writing this essay, I am still very new to Typescript as a language. This only serves to make my belief even more evident, that Typescript is an exceptionally easy language to grasp without prior education or experience. It cuts away at a lot of the specifics in other languages that may hinder newer users' progress, like allowing for types like "number" instead of int, float, double, etc. This allows for programmers to focus on the logic of their code rather than its specific wording.

I have recently performed an athletic software engineering task in Typescript, or rather a timed coding exercise that put a strong limitation on the time I had to complete a program. The fact that I was able to accomplish this exercise, while only finding myself with 2 or 3 typos to fix in the end, speaks to how accessible Typescript is to newer users. Although there certainly is an element of stress involved with having such a tight time constraint, it helped me to focus in my entirety on the task at hand with no distractions. I think that it has great potential as a learning tool for those who are willing to have insight on their own mistakes, shortcomings, and how they could improve them.
