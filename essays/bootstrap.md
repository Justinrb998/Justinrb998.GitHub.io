## Developer Dialects

  Learning a new language is not an easy undertaking. Although doing so is certainly much less difficult in regards to coding, rather than in spoken or written languages, it can still be challenging to find, understand, and remember all of the terminology and standard/existing methods. It is not hard to imagine then why some might find it frustrating to learn something like a UI Framework, a collection of new tools and methods to add upon the language they are likely still learning. It functions almost as a language inside of a language, with new "words" that have unique meanings and "grammar" that must be adhered to, even more so than might be necessary in a spoken language. However, there is quite the distinction between a UI framework and a language dialect; while dialects are variations of an existing language, UI frameworks are more like upgrades. 

## The Benefits of Bilingualism

  If a programmer must dedicate time and effort to learn a framework's terminology, then they would expect to be rewarded for doing so. I believe that in the case of Bootstrap-5, there are certainly great boons to be had. Bootstrap has many "components", such as buttons, dropdown menus, navigation bars, footers, etc. These are things that you could make in an html file, but many of which might take considerable amounts of code to do so without Bootstrap. Bootstrap-5 also comes with an icon library, allowing coders to easily implement common icons in their webpageï¼Œsuch as social media site logos, page navigation icons or buttons you might find on nearly every digital shopfront on the internet.

Much of the customization of a website is often done in a .css file. The amount of code that one might have to write to create a unique looking website is easy to understate and often taken for granted. Bootstrap-5 allows for much easier customization when it comes to websites, making design choices take longer to come up with rather than take longer to implement. Bootstrap-5's formatting improvements also allow for much easier website conversions for window dimensions and mobile device screens, an often overlooked and greatly impactful feature. Customization options and overall UI improvements make Bootstrap-5 a powerful tool in a website developer's hands.
