When conducting a group project, it is important to manage time accordingly so that nobody is left behind, but also so that work is done before deadlines are due. Some deadlines are not as obvious, since things like merging different members' works and deploying a website can take greatly varying times. As such, it is necessary to know not just how long things took to have done, but also how long things will take to do. Since I do not believe any of my team members are capable of peering into the future, we must settle for estimation.

## Method of Estimating Effort

In my opinion, estimating the amount of time that an issue takes is more of a gut feeling, perhaps from previous experiences and projects. Many assignments that I have been given in the past have been similar in scope to the issues i tackled so far, so I have used my past projects as reference for estimating issues in the present.

## Benefits of Effort Estimation

The benefits of effort estimation are strongly linked to their accuracy in my perspective. A ballpark estimation of two hours means that giving myself 3-4 hours to accomplish a goal is likely to result in me succeeding in my endeavors, however, if an estimation is wildly off it can lead to deadlines being missed and time crunches. For example, I believed that merging the branches and deploying the server could be done in 4-5 hours, so I gave myself 6 to finish before the deadline. Unfortunately, the amount of effort still required to merge everyones' branches and fix all the errors derived both from their merging, and from their state of completion, was much greater than that, and I ended up spending over 8 hours merging and deploying the website, missing the deadline.

## Benefits and Method of Tracking Actual Effort

I would argue that I did not strongly monitor my actual effort, and most of my figures are from remembering my starting time and ending time, as well as looking at submission times from start to finish. Therefore, I do not believe that I could honestly attest to the benefits of tracking my progress. I imagine that if I had worked in seperate chunks of time I would have greatly appreciated seeing how much I could complete in that amount of time, but since I just crunched it all in one sitting I didn't keep track of time until it was already done.

## Conclusions

As mentioned earlier, a faulty estimation can lead to missed deadlines and more stressful working conditions. Without mystical powers, there is not much else we developers can do to manage our time efficiently. That said, estimations are still greatly useful if used not as guidelines for how long you NEED to complete a project, but rather how long you SHOULD take to complete it. Using estimations as a way to figure out if you're coding at a good pace, or generally on track to beat a deadline, is still a good tool to learn and use.
