  In the modern era, software development is becoming ever increasingly accessible, and as such many large companies no longer have such a monopoly on coding prowess. Groups of individual coders can both provide companies with a cheaper alternative to full time developers, but also work together to form projects that rival those of the professionals. This can be achieved through three concepts: open source development, coding standards, and Agile project management.


  Open source software development promotes collaboration by allowing anyone to observe, create, modify, and distribute code. This has created global networks of developers that can find bugs, suggest improvements, and strengthen security. Examples such as Linux, Godot, and Blender demonstrate how countless innovators can build something greater than the individual. Developers benefit from exposure to new coding practices and from solving practical issues, and companies can gain high-quality, low-cost solutions. Open source code is also much more trustworthy, as you could spot any malicious software or system crashing code. Lastly, open source code allows for a greater sense of community, as it allows for users of a product to suggest and even implement their own improvements to a program, and allows for much easier modding in forms ranging from mods in games to development tools in software development environments.


  Coding standards are critical in any software development, especially in open source, where several developers may be qualified to contribute and work on a particular codebase. Anyone who has worked in a team will tell you that sometimes the hardest part of coding is just figuring out what your colleagues have written and how you could even approach it. Standards instruct how to code, format, and document, and the produced code is more readable, easier to debug, and simpler to maintain. Consistency prevents unreadable code, difficult to understand bugs, and newcomer onboarding time. This is enforced by linters and formatters, which offer automatic quality code inspections across teams.The amount of time that a consistent coding form will save can not possibly be ignored.


  Agile project management helps open source and coding standards in that it is an adaptive, iterative process of development. Agile focuses on programming software in small chunks, getting feedback frequently, and responding to change promptly. Code created in systems like GitHub can be separated into branches, and when bugs arise or quality drops, the branch can remain separate until the issues are sorted out. Not to mention, bugs become exponentially harder to tackle the larger the amount of code possibly responsible for them is, so separating work into pieces can greatly aid the bug-fixing process. These practices are especially valuable in open source projects, given that contributors can remotely and asynchronously work on them.


  In conclusion, open source software development, coding standards, and Agile project management are three complementary components for producing high quality, constantly improving, user-friendly software. Open source provides the strength of community and transparency, coding standards improve code quality and consistency, and Agile project management provides flexibility and steady improvement with less detrimental bugs. All three combined bring with them a new era in which anyone and everyone can achieve projects greater than themselves.
