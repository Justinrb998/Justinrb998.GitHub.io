I'm currently in the process of developing games in my spare time. My plan is to build small games that contain some features of what my first "real game" would contain. This would allow me to learn more about what might help me in my future games, gain some code that could serve as the baseline to be built upon, and also divide what would be a monumental task into smaller pieces.

In doing so, I must learn about multiple aspects of game development, namely art, sound, story, music, and of course programming design. I've recently been working on customizing a system designed for dual-grid tilemaps, to allow for multiple tilemaps to overlay based on specific conditions.
