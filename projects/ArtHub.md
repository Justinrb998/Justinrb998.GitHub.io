ArtHub was created as part of a group project to provide a website for artists to showcase their art and market themselves. It allows for users to upload their artworks to the website and create a profile for themselves.

I worked on creating the uploads and gallery pages, allowing users to both share their own creations and view artworks posted by others. Here is how it looks when viewing an artwork:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="../img/BootstrapWebsites.jpg" style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; width: 100%; max-width: 1000px; height: auto;" alt="ArtHub Image Viewer">
</div>

Creating this website helped me learn more about working with databases, designing webpages for multiple window sizes, and the general flow between back-end vs front-end code. Here is a link to a more extensive overview of my project:
